NativeAdView wraps all your Ad components inside it and provides a `Context` through which each component loads an ad.

## Importing

The NativeAdView is imported as the default component from the library.

```jsx
import NativeAdView from "react-native-admob-native-ads";
```

## Basic usage

```jsx
<NativeAdView adUnitID="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2247696110">
  <View>/* All other ad components */</View>
</NativeAdView>
```

## Loading an Ad

Ads are loaded imperitively. You need to provide a ref to the `NativeAdView` to load ads.

```jsx
const AdView = () => {
  const nativeAdViewRef = useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    nativeAdViewRef.current?.loadAd();
  }, []);

  return (
    <NativeAdView
      ref={nativeAdViewRef}
      adUnitID="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/2247696110"
    >
      <View>/* All other ad components */</View>
    </NativeAdView>
  );
};
```

## Preloading ads
You probably do not want the user to wait for the ad to load. Hence loading the ads before showing them makes the ad experience a lot better. From v0.6.0 of library, you can preload ads by a repository anywhere in the app.

```jsx
AdManager.registerRepository({
  name: 'imageAd',
  adUnitId: NATIVE_AD_ID,
  numOfAds: 3,
  nonPersonalizedAdsOnly: false,
  videoOptions: {
    mute: false,
  },
  expirationPeriod: 3600000, // in milliseconds (optional)
  mediationEnabled: false,
}).then(result => {
  console.log('registered: ', result);
});
```

And then later you can show the preloaded ads in the app. As soon as an ad is shown, it will be discarded from the repository and a new ad will be preloaded in it's place.

```jsx
const AdView = () => {
  const nativeAdViewRef = useRef();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    nativeAdViewRef.current?.loadAd();
  }, []);
  return (
    <NativeAdView
      ref={nativeAdViewRef}
      repository="imageAd"
    >
      <View>/* All other ad components */</View>
    </NativeAdView>
  );
};
```
You can register multiple repositories. For example a repository for videoAds, imageAds, banners etc and so on. You are in full control.

:::tip

To prevent `NativeAdView` from rerendering and requesting new ads, you can wrap your component in `React.memo()` or use `React.PureComponent`.

:::

:::caution

From version `0.4.0` onwards ads do not refresh automatically to save bandwidth and reduce the amount of requests sent to Admob. You must only reload an ad when you are sure that you need to reload it.

## Props

### `style`

Style for your NativeAdView.

### `repository`
Repositories preload ads for the NativeAdView and are useful to show ads instantly without any delay when user navigates to new screen.

Set Ad Unit ID for Native Advanced Ads that you created on your AdMob account.

| Type     | Required | Platform |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `string` | Yes      | All      |

### `adUnitID`

Set Ad Unit ID for Native Advanced Ads that you created on your AdMob account. **If you are using repositories to preload ads, defining `adUnitID is not required.**
 
| Type     | Required | Platform |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `string` | No       | All      |

:::tip

Remember that there are two types of Admob Native Advanced Ad IDs. One is for simple image ads and other is for video ads.

:::

:::caution

During development you should never use your Admob IDs. Instead you can grab the test Admob IDs for [iOS](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/test-ads) and [Android](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/test-ads) from Google Developers Website. If you use your own Ad IDs, you must add your device to test-devices.

:::

### `enableTestMode`

Setting this to true will load a placeholder ad (Not from Admob server) incase you have no internet etc so you can design your ad as you want with ease. Remember to set the `adUnitID` to null when using this so the placeholder ad is not replaced by a real ad.
