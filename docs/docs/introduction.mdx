If you are working on a React Native Application, you might feel limited when it comes to displaying ads that look beautiful and match your App's look and feel. Usually when you show ads in your app, they are loaded inside a `WebView` and that is why you cannot modify them except changing the width and height in some cases.

## How is this library different?

This library on the other hand do not load ads in a `WebView`. It uses [Native Advanced](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/native/start) ad format to display ads. We request Admob servers to send us the ad information such as images, headlines, videos etc. Then we send this information over the bridge and render it in `View` and `Text` components execpt a few exceptions where we use our own custom components.

## Can I design the ads myself?

Yes absolutely you can! There are no limiations. You can design ads that look just like your App's design and colors.

1.  [Admob Native Advanced Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/native/start) format
